# buff_163_scraper
Does what buff_scraper does, but better (and on a slightly different website).
On first launch, the program will create list.txt file and exits. After you insert buff.163.com links per line and re-launch, the program will go through every page searching for profitable buys within the list.
If found, it will display it in the CLI. The program runs infinitely. It waits for 3 minutes after every list traversal.
